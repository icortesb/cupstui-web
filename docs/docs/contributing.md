## Building

```sh
make build   # static binary
make test
make vet
make fmt
```

The suite runs without CUPS. One integration test talks to the local
daemon and skips itself when it cannot reach one, so `go test ./...`
passes on a machine with no printing stack.

## Re-recording the demo

```sh
make demo   # needs vhs and podman
```

The recording runs inside a container built from `scripts/demo.Containerfile`,
never against the machine's own CUPS: the GIF is published, and the
printers, home directory and page log of whoever records it are nobody's
business. Everything on screen is invented there by
`scripts/demo-fixture.sh` — two queues pointed at a local socket that
discards the data, a handful of completed jobs so the page log has rows,
three held jobs, one undeliverable one so the log has a warning in it, and
a home directory for the file browser to open in. The Makefile removes the
container from a trap, so nothing is left running even if vhs fails
partway.

## Working on it

Behaviour comes with a test. The interesting parts of this program are the
ones that talk to CUPS, and they are covered without a daemon:
`internal/cups` takes an `ipp.Adapter`, so a fake one stands in, and the
adapter tests run against a pretend cupsd on a temporary unix socket.

Changes to the interface should keep two invariants, both of which have
tests: every screen paints the full width of the terminal, and text fields
keep their keys instead of losing them to the global shortcuts.

Comments explain why, not what. If a decision looks odd — talking IPP for
reads but shelling out to `lp` for submission, for one — the reason
belongs next to it, because the next person will otherwise "fix" it.

## Reporting a problem

Include the CUPS version (`cupsd --version`), the distribution, and
whether the server is local or remote. `cupstui -check` prints what the
machine can and cannot do, which answers most of it.
